# Eric Meyer - CSS Reset Stylesheet

Eric Meyer's CSS reset stylesheet as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), delivered as a [Compass Extension](http://compass-style.org/docs/tutorials/extensions/) and [Ruby Gem](http://rubygems.org/).

For more information: [http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)

## Installation and Usage

### Compass Extension

To install as a Ruby Gem to use this as a Compass Extension, run the following in your Terminal app.

    gem install meyer-reset

Then add `require 'meyer-reset'` to your Compass config file.

Using this in your Sass stylesheet is pretty easy. Simply import the extension into your stylesheet (preferably as the first import or declaration in your Sass stylesheet).

If you look at [the extension](https://github.com/adamstac/meyer-reset/blob/master/stylesheets/_meyer-reset.scss), you will notice that we are "including" the mixin `@include meyer-reset` for you in the last line. All you will need to do is import and go.

    @import "meyer-reset";
    
    ...

### Simple Sass Partial

For non Compass users, or someone who just wants to use this as a simple Sass partial vs installing as a Ruby Gem and Compass extension. In your terminal app, navigate to where you want to download this to.

For example: `cd path/to/project/sass`

Then use curl to pull down the raw file.

    curl -0 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamstac/meyer-reset/master/stylesheets/_meyer-reset.scss

The same rules apply as mentioned above. All you will need to do is import and go.

    @import "meyer-reset";
    
    ...

## For fun

For those who want to learn about how to use Rake and want to play with how Sass and Compass work when compiling, run the command `rake -T` to see a list of rake tasks that: clear, build and release this gem, and compile and convert Sass.

Dig into the [Rakefile](https://github.com/adamstac/meyer-reset/blob/master/Rakefile) to see what makes all this happen.

    rake css:clear     # Clear the styles
    rake gem:build     # Build the gem
    rake gem:release   # Build and release the gem
    rake sass:compile  # Compile new styles
    rake sass:convert  # Converts the Sass to SCSS
